### Hello! 👋

I'm a software engineer building polished products and web experiences using modern tech stack. My expertise ranges from working independently to leading teams towards project success as a tech/team lead.

I'm also a Rust and functional programming aficionado fascinated by design of compilers and programming languages. Sometimes I write music, mostly drone-ambient, which is available for free on my [Bandcamp](https://hypnosense.bandcamp.com) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1EqX9erOVQHCVlAwGihPS2?si=U6WzSwm0RSCnS70g_sVZXQ).
